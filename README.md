# DekkersAlgorithm
Working with multiple threads that uses a shared resource needs a mechanism to prevent race conditions and handle concurrent access to the resource. 

```Java
do{

  // critical section

} while (!done)
```

This is an example on how to implement the five attempt described by dekker's algorithm in Java.

## First Attempt



## Second Attempt

## Third Attempt

## Forth Attempt

## Final Attempt
